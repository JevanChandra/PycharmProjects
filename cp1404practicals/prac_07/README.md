# Prac 7 CP1404 Jevan Chandra

## Introduction
This is a repo made to keep all the things I did in the CP1404 practicals.
My name is Jevan Chandra and I want to be good at coding which is why I took this class

### Clean Code
Things I have learned about clean code:
- Functions should be used regularly to make it look cleaner and to avoid repetition
- Using the correct naming convention is very important to make it much less stressful when reviewing the code
- Adding an empty line after every if statement helps in making the code look cleaner as it is not just one whole chunk
