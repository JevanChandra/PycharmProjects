# 1st question
For practical tasks it is really hard to get an estimate as I would do some practicals for a long amount of time but 
some in a short amount of time due to other assignments. I would say that I have improved as the weeks went by.

# 2nd question 
It has helped me to see how to check my own code where I learned from reviewing other codes. I also learned that I keep
making the same mistake over and over again because my peers would point them out while reviewing my code.

# 3rd question
I would say that I am not a fan of the recorded lectures. I find that having the lecture face to face is much better than
having the lecture recorded. This is because I feel more focused when it is face to face, and I can ask questions
directly in class.
